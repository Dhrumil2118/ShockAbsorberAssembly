# Shock Absorber Assembly - SolidWorks 3D Design

This project features the complete 3D modeling and assembly of a **mechanical shock absorber**, designed in **SolidWorks**. It includes detailed part designs, a full assembly.

---

## 📦 Project Structure

- `Parts/` – Individual 3D part files (`.SLDPRT`)
- `Assembly/` – Complete SolidWorks assembly file (`.SLDASM`)
- `Exported/` – Universal formats (STEP, IGES, PDF)
- `Images/` – Screenshots and rendered previews

---

## 🛠️ Design Overview

**Shock Absorber Components:**
- **Spring** – A helical coil spring designed for compression and energy absorption.
- **Piston Rod** – Moves within the cylinder and connects to the spring mechanism.
- **Cylinder** – The outer housing of the shock absorber that supports all internal parts.
- **End Caps & Mounts** – For connecting the assembly to chassis or load-bearing points.

This design simulates how a shock absorber dissipates kinetic energy using spring compression and rebound.
